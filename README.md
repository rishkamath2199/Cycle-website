# About the project
This is a web app built by me , for cyclists, who can track their progress, link up with other cyclists and much more.

## How to run this project

#### Note: Since this project Runs on firebase, I cant share my credentials over here, in order to run it , you need to make your own firebase auth profile over at "https://firebase.google.com/" and head over to the documentation and follow the steps. If you are still confused after reading the documentation, open the youtube link "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKwu15ldZ7k" and follow along. Shout out to Web Dev Simplified.

To start the project , open your terminal and head into the project directory, and type:
#### **npm install**
this should install the node_modules file in your directory. 

After going through the firebase installation process, set the API keys in a .env.local accordingly and directly run the project with:
#### **npm start**

This should start the project on localhost and you should see the home page.
